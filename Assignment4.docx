Writing Software for IoT


Document Overview:
This document outlines the details of device coding and customer user guide for proposed raspberry pi application which would semi-automated stock management for the company Wood Stocks.
Raspberry Pi would be connected to a portable screen which could be used to display the current stock, update stock and also to store the stock to a remote computer over wireless network using file transfer protocol.

Python Code:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import ftplib
Inventory = {'A0001':5, 'A0002':2, 'A0003':0, 'A0004':3} # Sample Inventory directory


def filetransfer():   # This function is to perform transfer of updated inventory to a remote machine using FTP Protocol

    FinalStock = "DailyStock.txt"
    ftp = ftplib.FTP('192.168.1.3') # Remote machine IP Address connected over wireless Network or same LAN 
    ftp.login("username", "password") # Remote machine Login details
    ftp.cwd('/c/user/Akash/desktop/IoT') #Directory Location of Remote machine where the Updated Stock details are stored 
    StockUpdate = open('/home/pi/Desktop/SkillageIT/Inventory') #To open the user updated inventory located at Raspberry Pi 
    ftp.storlines('STOR ' + FinalStock, StockUpdate) # To start FTP transfer the remote machine
    print("STOCK UPDATE COMPLETED ON REMOTE PC")

def Options(): # This function is to prompt user to provide input options from list of possible record update actions
    print("Press 1 For updating inventory") 
    print("Press 2 For checking inventory")
    print("Press 3 IF Update Completed and proceeding with FTP updated file to remote machine")
    return input("Select the option:")

Selected = Options()

while True:
    if Selected == '1':
        updateinv = input('Enter the Item name to b added : ')
        Qty = input('New Count after stock check : ')
        Inventory[updateinv] = Qty
        print("STOCK UPDATED ON RASPBERRY PI")
        Selected = Options()
        
    elif Selected == '2':
        for key, value in Inventory.items():
            print("{}:{}".format(key, value))
        Selected = Options()
        
    elif Selected == '3':
        print("STOCK IS NOW BEING FTP'd TO REMOTE MACHINE")
        filetransfer()
        break
     
    
  

Options()

Brief Overview of code
This code is comprises of two main function:
1)	Function Options() 
This part of code presents to the user list of options available to update the stock

2)	Function Filetransfer() 
This part of code uses the imported python inbuilt library ftplib and sets up a FTP session between raspberry pi and remote machine for transfer of updated stock.
